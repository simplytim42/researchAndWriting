* used for coding books teaching a language, online courses etc.
* it's not about remembering, there are too many languages with different syntax, its about understanding. Syntax reference can be acquired easily when you need it. If you understand the code you can optimise it for each situation.
* If starting a new language, browse the official documentation and follow any tutorials they have.

1. repeat the code in the learning resource.
2. ensure you understand every part of it.
3. tweak and play around with it.
4. use the same logic to build something different.
5. make mistakes and fix them.

### Snippets

* store snippets of code for ref to syntax.
* snippets/php/framework etc.

* Top-down approach
  * start with an idea for a project
    * must be something you would use: win win
